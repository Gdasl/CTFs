## Solving

This was also easy, we are given a very small ```p``` and ```e```. The former is easily factored ```2531257 = 509 Ã— 4973```. Now all we need to do is apply basic steps of calculating ```d = modinv(e,phi)``` where ```phi = (p-1) x (q-1)```.

The trick here was to quickly see that the message had spaces for a reason. Basically, up to 2 chars were encoded at a time. You could then simply convert to chr and read the flag.
