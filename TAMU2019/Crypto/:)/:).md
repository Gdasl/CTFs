## Solving

This was a MEAN challenge. And I mean MEAN. I spent a lot of time trying to decode it, sifting through different bases like we saw in other CTFs (looking at you ICECtf). In the end nothing would work so I went back to the basics. It turned out to be a simple repeating key xor.....

Not gonna comment further on this, I think I'm not the only one who felt awash with shame when recognizing it.
