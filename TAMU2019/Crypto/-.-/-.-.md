## Solving

It took me longer than I care to admit for something that should have been straightforward given the multiple hints. It was basically morse code where ```.``` was replaced by ```di``` and ```-``` by ```dah```. A ```t``` acted as a word delimiter and ``` ```  as letter delimiter. Decoding the string yielded a hex string which again decoded yielded a bunch of junk with the flag in the middle.
