# TAMU CTF
Well howdy partner! This was one of the coolest CTFs I participated in. The challenges ranged from easy to difficult, including some curve balls, and some straight-up mean ones (looking at you veggies).

My team, myself and I managed to get 96th place without PenTesting, successfully completing all Crypto, Webs, Secure Coding and all but 1 of the Misc, Reversing and Android.

All in all I learned a ton of stuff and had heaps of fun, got to know some super interesting people. I will definitely participate next year.
