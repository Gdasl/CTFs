## First steps

No source code, only an address. This doesn't bode well. Basically, the script first asks for input, encrypts it and sends it back. We are also greeted by an ominous "Level 0" hinting there might be more (SPOILER ALERT: there are). So I went level by level until the end.

## Owning this
### Level 0

Plain morse. Simply decrypt and send. Easy peasy.

### Level 1

### Level 2

### Level 3

### Level 4

### Level 5

### Level 6

### Final level: Level 7
