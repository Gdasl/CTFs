# TUCTF 2018

This was one of the funnier CTFs this year. I've come to really appreciate the smaller student-organized events for not only the really fun challenges but also the sense of community you encounter on the discords. You also usually end up seing the same people which reinforces the fun.

There were 5 categories of challenges, the usual suspects. I focused on all but pwn since I suck at it. It's on my bucket list to get better but this weekend was the third CTF in a row and I had to pace myself a bit. The reverse were very easy, the crypto ranged from easy to semi-difficult, webs were actually easy in hidsight and mis were easy as well, though I didn't really try the last 2 challenges.

Overall it was fun to play, though the web involved a bit too much guessing for my taste.
