# NACTF 2019

This was a very fun CTF, I liked the difficulty as well as the variety of challenges. It was obviously a beginner's ctf (explains the absence of big names), geared towards MS/HS and maybe freshmen. In other words, ideal to relax and have some fun.

I ended up solving most of the challenges except Random2 and Cell2 and all pwns after a couple of days. I then started working on the pwn since it's one of my big weakness. I got all of them save for the 2 loopys. I finished exactly number 50 whihc is OK.

Given the format and difficulty I'll have one massive write-up for the entire CTF organized by category, without the flags such as to not spoil the fun entirely.

One more interesting thing, especially since I will soon be working on a CTF as an organizer, is the Points vs. Solves scatter. It shows a nice curve with a few outliers, as would be expected:
